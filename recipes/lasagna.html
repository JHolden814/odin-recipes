                    Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch over medium heat
                    until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
                    Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, 
                    fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water
                    for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta
                    cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the ovent to 375 degrees F (190 degreesC).</li>

                <p>
                    To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
                    baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2
                    of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
                    Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan
                    cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                    Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray
                    or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
